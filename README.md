**If you're reading this, you should already be recording your screen using QuickTime Player with your microphone enabled walking us through your solution as you work.**

## Prerequisites

First, fork this sandbox to your own account.

We recommend regularly saving your progress to avoid any data loss.

## Test

### Task 1 - Toggleable Items

- Tapping on any item should select the user and turn the background color to `lightskyblue`
- Tapping again should unselect the user

### Task 2 - First Names Concatenated Title

- Display a title containing a comma separated list of the first names of the actively selected users. Don't worry about styling.

### Task 3 - Optimize

- When toggling a user, only the title and the user's row which is being toggled should re-render
